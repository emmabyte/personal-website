			"faqs": [
				{
					"question": "üí° What kinds of problems were you hired to solve at Haven?",
					"answer": "Haven Ministries had a number of legacy systems that were underperforming or unstable. I was brought on to lead a multi-phase initiative to modernize the organization‚Äôs digital infrastructure‚Äîstarting with performance and reliability issues, then revamping core giving flows and content systems, and finally rebuilding the entire site from the ground up with a modern tech stack."
				},
				{
					"question": "üß± What has your role involved beyond writing code?",
					"answer": "As the only full-time engineer, I take full ownership over software development across Haven‚Äôs digital properties. That includes architecture decisions, infrastructure setup, DevOps, contractor coordination, and long-term project planning. I also serve as the primary technical advisor to leadership and content teams, helping shape the organization‚Äôs digital strategy."
				},
				{
					"question": "üöÄ What were the outcomes of the first phase of your modernization work?",
					"answer": "I refactored and containerized critical portions of our legacy codebase and migrated our infrastructure to a managed hosting platform with auto-scaling. This brought our average page speed scores from the 40s to the high 90s, and cut downtime incidents from 10+ per month to nearly zero."
				},
				{
					"question": "üí≥ How did you improve the donations experience?",
					"answer": "In phase two of the rebuild, I architected a fully integrated donation system‚Äîcombining a managed donation platform with custom CMS syncing and a rebuilt Shopify storefront. This significantly reduced overhead for our content managers and gave donors a more seamless and trustworthy giving experience."
				},
				{
					"question": "üåê What‚Äôs happening in phase three?",
					"answer": "Phase three involves rebuilding the Haven website from the ground up using a modern web stack, moving away from over a decade of WordPress legacy architecture. My focus has been on making the new platform more performant, maintainable, and flexible for future content and donation strategies."

				},
				{
					"question": "üõ† What kind of work did you do on this project?",
					"answer": "Over the course of 600+ hours, I handled everything from system architecture and full-stack development to DevOps and developer experience tooling.

				},
				{
					"question": "ü§ù Is this project still active?",
					"answer": "While it‚Äôs no longer a live product, the codebase is open-source and publicly available as a modern learning platform starter kit. It continues to serve as a portfolio piece, tech reference, and contribution-friendly project for developers interested in scalable web apps."
				},
				{
					"question": "üå± What did you learn from building this?",
					"answer": "Leading the full lifecycle of a product‚Äîespecially through a major pivot‚Äîtaught me how to design for scale, adapt to changing visions, and work collaboratively across technical and non-technical roles.

This progression laid the foundation for my transition into a full software engineering role later on."
				},
				{
					"question": "üéì Were you working full-time during school?",
					"answer": "For most of my academic career, yes‚ÄîI was working full-time at Haven Ministries while attending school full-time.

				},
				{
					"question": "üîÑ Why did your role shift over time?",
					"answer": "As my technical skills matured, I naturally took on more engineering work.
