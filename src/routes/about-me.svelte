					With a background in computer science and a love for clean, efficient code, I specialize
					in creating robust applications using modern technologies. I believe in the power of
					thoughtful design and user-centered development to create experiences that are not just
					functional, but delightful to use.
				</p>
				<p>
					My journey in tech began with a curiosity about how things work, which evolved into a
					career building solutions that make a difference. Whether it's optimizing database
					queries, crafting responsive interfaces, or architecting scalable systems, I approach each
					challenge with enthusiasm and attention to detail.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring hiking trails, experimenting with new
					cooking recipes, or contributing to open-source projects that align with my values of
					accessibility and inclusion in technology.
